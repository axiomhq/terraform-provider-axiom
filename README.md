# Axiom Terraform Provider

A Terraform provider that allows you to manage resources in [Axiom](https://axiom.co/).

Axiom lets you make the most of your event data without compromises: all your data, all the time, for all possible needs. Say goodbye to data sampling, waiting times, and hefty fees.

üìñ For more information, see the [documentation](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/axiomhq/axiom/latest/docs).

üîß To see the provider in action, check out the [example](example/main.tf).

## Prerequisites

- [Sign up for a free Axiom account](https://app.axiom.co/register). All you need is an email address.
- [Create an advanced API token in Axiom](https://axiom.co/docs/reference/tokens#create-advanced-api-token) with the permissions to perform the actions you want to use. For example, to use Terraform to create and update datasets, create the advanced API token with these permissions.
- [Create a Terraform account](https://app.terraform.io/signup/account).
- [Install the Terraform CLI](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli).

## Install the provider

To install the Axiom Terraform Provider from the [Terraform Registry](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/axiomhq/axiom/latest), follow these steps:

1. Add the following code to your Terraform configuration file. Replace `API_TOKEN` with the Axiom API token you have generated. For added security, store the API token in an environment variable.

    ```hcl
    terraform {
      required_providers {
        axiom = {
          source  = "axiomhq/axiom"
        }
      }
    }

    provider "axiom" {
      api_token = "API_TOKEN"
    }
    ```

2. In your terminal, go to the folder of your main Terraform configuration file, and then run the command `terraform init`.

## Create a dataset

To create a dataset in Axiom using the provider, add the following code to your Terraform configuration file:

```hcl
resource "axiom_dataset" "test_dataset" {
  name = "test_dataset"
  description = "This is a test dataset created by Terraform."
}
```

## Access existing dataset

To access an existing dataset in Axiom using the provider, follow these steps:

1. Determine the ID of the Axiom dataset using the [`getDatasets` query of the Axiom API](https://axiom.co/docs/restapi/endpoints/getDatasets).
2. Add the following code to your Terraform configuration file. Replace `DATASET_ID` with the ID of the Axiom dataset.

```hcl
data "axiom_dataset" "test_dataset" {
  id = "DATASET_ID"
}
```
